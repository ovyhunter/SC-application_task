# Frontend Web Developer Application

We're happy you're interested in applying for the position of `Frontend Web developer` at **SportCompass**.

We'd like you to create an application to showcase some of your abilities. You can make this as simple or as complex as you'd like. You can use the folder structure in this repository as a way of organizing your project if you want but it's not required.

Here's what you need to do;

1. Design a simple product listing page for an e-commerce store.
2. Have a responsive layout. (prefferably use Bootstrap4)
3. Each product should have at least one image.
4. Give the user the ability to add/edit/delete items in their cart. (use your JS skills here).
5. Add a readme to your project with a short description of your solution. (can be as short as 2 sentences)
6. When you're happy with your solution don't forget to send it to us! (repository link or zip)

Bonus points; (in case you want to have more fun)

1. Swap broken images on error with a defualt one.
2. Persist the data.
3. Add some testing.


Good luck!
